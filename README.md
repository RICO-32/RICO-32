## Introduction

RICO-32 is a fantasy console that combines the nostalgic charm of retro game development with modern Rust performance. It features a 128×128 pixel game screen with a 16-color palette, Lua scripting support, and a built-in console for debugging and logging.

The console is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing developers to create games quickly using Lua while benefiting from Rust's performance and safety guarantees. Whether you're prototyping a game idea or creating a full retro-style game, RICO-32 provides the tools you need.

## Features

- **128×128 Pixel Display**: Classic retro resolution with 4× pixel scaling for modern displays
- **16-Color Palette**: Predefined color palette for consistent retro aesthetics
- **Lua Scripting**: Full Lua 5.4 support with custom module system
- **Built-in Console**: Integrated console engine for logging and debugging
- **Sprite Support**: Create custom 32x32 sprites within the console and use and load them in the game
- **Input Handling**: Mouse and keyboard input with frame-accurate state tracking
- **Frame Rate Control**: Configurable frame rate with delta time support
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between game engine, console engine, and scripting
- **Hot Reload Support**: Restart functionality for rapid iteration
- **Full cartridge support**: .r32 files are cartridges that can be shared with other users. RICO-32 will auto-load main.r32 from the root directory, so make sure to have the main cartridge there.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (1.70 or later)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- A C compiler (for building native dependencies) (i think)

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RICO-32/RICO-32.git
   cd RICO-32
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   Or run the release binary directly:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Run RICO-32**: Execute `cargo run --release` and your RICO-32 will start!

2. **Create your game scripts**: Edit `r32/main.lua` to start building your game.
   
3. **Build the game**: Use the sprite engine to create and edit sprites and the console to debug your game.

4. Running just the game without the debugging and editor features can be done by running. The main.r32 cartridge will be used.
```bash
cargo run --release --bin console
```
The following can be added in order to run the console as a standalone exe without any need for on-disk file cartridge storage. The base64 string can be generated using commands described in [Cartridge & Lua Files](#cartridge--lua-files).
```bash
cargo run --release --bin console -- --with-cart=<full_base64_string>
```

### Example Game

```lua
function start()
    rico:log("Welcome to RICO-32!")
    rico:set_frame_rate(60)
end

function update(dt)
    rico:clear("BLACK")
    rico:print_scr(10, 10, "WHITE", "Hello, World!")
    
    local mouse = rico:mouse()
    if mouse.pressed then
        rico:circle(mouse.x, mouse.y, 5, "RED")
    end
end
```

## Sprite Engine

RICO-32 includes a built-in sprite editor for creating and managing 32×32 pixel sprites. Access the sprite editor from the main interface to design sprites that can be used in your games.

### Features

- **32×32 Sprite Canvas**: Edit sprites pixel-by-pixel with a 3× zoomed preview
- **60-Sprite Sheet**: Store up to 60 sprites (expandable) in a persistent sprite sheet
     - Sprite sheet is stored in assets/sheet.sprt for persistency
     - RICO-32 features an inbuilt sprite file spec to store and read the sprite sheet for the engine
- **Drawing Tools**:
  - **Pencil**: Draw individual pixels with the selected color
  - **Fill**: Flood-fill connected areas with the selected color
  - **Eraser**: Remove pixels (set to transparent)
  - **Select**: Create rectangular selections for advanced editing
- **Selection Tools**:
  - Click and drag to create rectangular selections
  - Move selections by clicking inside and dragging
  - Copy (Ctrl+C) and paste (Ctrl+V) selections
  - Flip horizontal/vertical within selections or entire sprite
  - Clear selected areas or entire sprite
- **Undo/Redo**: Full undo/redo support with keyboard shortcuts
- **16-Color Palette**: Quick access to all RICO-32 colors
- **Auto-Save Indicator**: Changes are marked with an asterisk (*) until saved

### Using the Sprite Editor

1. **Select a sprite**: Click on any sprite in the sprite sheet panel (bottom of screen). Scroll to view more sprites.
2. **Choose a tool**: Click one of the tool buttons (Pencil, Eraser, Fill, Select)
3. **Pick a color**: Click a color from the palette at the top
4. **Draw**: Click and drag on the canvas to draw or use tools
5. **Save**: Click the save button to persist changes to disk

### Adding More Sprites

Click the **+** button at the bottom of the sprite sheet panel to add 6 more sprite slots. The sprite sheet automatically expands to accommodate your needs.

### In-Game Usage

Load and draw sprites in your Lua scripts using the `draw()` function:

```lua
function start()
    rico:set_frame_rate(60)
end

function update(dt)
    rico:clear("BLACK")
    
    -- Draw sprite 0 at position (48, 48)
    rico:draw(48, 48, 0)
    
    -- Draw sprite 5 at position (80, 48)
    rico:draw(80, 48, 5)
end
```

## Cartridge & Lua Files

- Lua files are **extracted to `r32/`** next to the executable and cartridge when a game is loaded.
- Users can **edit files externally** with their favorite editor.
- RICO-32 automatically watches the r32/ folder for any changes made through any IDE and auto recompiles the cartridge to be instantly loaded whenever the game is restarted through restarting the whole engine or the inbuilt game restart.
- Sprites are **never written to r32/**, remaining fully in memory and the cartridge, and must be saved to the cartridge using the checkmark within the sprite editor.
- Cartridges fully contain all information related to all RICO-32 games, and thus RICO-32 games can be shared easily by sharing .r32 files or using their Base64 version.
- Cartridges can be encoded and decoded into base64 for easy sharing using the following commands.
  ```bash
  cargo run --release --bin cart encode <cartridge_file_path>
  cargo run --release --bin cart decode <full_base64_string> 
  ```
  The encoded string will be pasted into the console for easy access and the decoded .r32 cartridge will be stored in main.r32 automatically for easy usage through the normal RICO-32 and game-only view.

### Note: all changes made to the r32/ directory while RICO-32 is not running will be discarded and overwritten with the cartridge upon initial RICO-32 startup.
